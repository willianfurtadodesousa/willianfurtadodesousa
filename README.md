## Hi there 👋

I'm a design professional transitioning into a career in web development. Committed to delivering efficient solutions and with experience in visual creations, I try to balance aesthetics and functionality.

During my free time, I work on personal projects to improve my skills. I love collaborating with other developers and staying up to date with the latest market trends.

I work well in a team, I have good communication and I am always looking to improve my knowledge.
