## Hi there üëã

I am a professional specialized in web design and development, committed to delivering efficient solutions and with extensive experience in visual creations. My goal is to balance aesthetics and functionality.

I love collaborating with other developers and I'm always up to date with the latest market trends. I value teamwork and good communication, always seeking to improve my knowledge and contribute to the success of collective projects.

I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my technical skills and aesthetic vision to projects, as well as being constantly willing to learn new tools and technologies.
